# Coursework for Creative Coding 2

### UAL: Creative Computing Institute
### With professor Mick Grierson
### By me, Stuart Leitch!

## The Code

All of this code is a second-run. Which is to say, I did all this once before, and this is the second time. Why do it again? Because my harddrive failed and I lost the entire quarter's code! Irrecoverably lost! Take this as a reminder to **back your shit up!**

### Week 1 & 2 - C++

* Introduction to C++ fundamentals: main.cpp, #include, printing to the console, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, preprocessing and compilation.
* Creating and using C++ objects: classes, .h (hpp) .cpp pairs, declaring and defining classes, basic macros.
* Getting started with openFrameworks
Understanding Pointers

#### Week 1 - C++ basics code: [source](/w1)
#### Week 2 - Open Frameworks basics code: [source](/w2/OF1)
Don't forget: make && make run 

### Week 3 & 4 - Python

* Getting started with Python : Python 2 vs 3, printing to the console, import, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, def
* Doing the Python Challenge!!!
* Using help() and DIR()
* Core libs : matplotlib, numpy, pandas, urllib, bs4, gensim, bokeh, flask.
* NLP tools in gensim.

### Week 5 & 6 - Python Machine Learning

* Introduction to Image Processing, Batch processing and Data Handling
* Basic Neural Networks by hand - Forward multiply, Forward add, backward pass, calculating derivatives and gradients, numerical gradient, analytic gradient, scaling the gradient to automatically adjust parameters. Back propagation for training Neural Networks.
* Introduction to Tensorflow

### Week 7 - More Python Machine Learning

* Neural Networks for image classification
* Using Tensorflow to do inference on pre-trained models
* Exploring CNNs, RNNs, GANs.

### Week 8 - Embedded development

* Using ARM architectures - Raspi for prototyping
* Python and C++ on ARM architectures
* Designing autonomous embedded systems
* Using simple sound and light sensors for interaction

### Week 9 - Project work
